Collect sosreport across distributed environments with one simple tool.

sos-collector is a tool intended for capturing sosreports on a selection of
hosts.  Even though tools such as Ansible exist which can perform this task,
the goal of this project is to provide a way to collect multiple sosreports
without the need for outside tooling.
